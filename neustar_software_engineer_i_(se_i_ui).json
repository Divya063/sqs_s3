As one of the few companies capable of knowing with certainty who is on the other end of every interaction, we\u2019re trusted by the world\u2019s great brands to make critical decisions some 20 billion times a day. We help marketers send timely and relevant messages to the right people. Because we can authoritatively tell a client exactly who is calling or connecting with them, we make critical real-time responses possible. And the same comprehensive information that enables our clients to direct and manage orders also stops attackers. We know when someone isn\u2019t who they claim to be, which helps stop fraud and denial of service before they\u2019re a problem. Because we\u2019re also an experienced manager of some of the world\u2019s most complex databases, we help clients control their online identity, registering and protecting their domain name, and routing traffic to the correct network address. By linking the most essential information with the people who depend on it, we provide more than 12,000 clients worldwide with decisions\u2014not just data.
